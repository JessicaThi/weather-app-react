<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

![screenshot](https://github.com/JessicaThi/weather-app-react/blob/main/src/assets/images/Clear.png)

Here you can see a screenshot of the project. Click on the link at the top or [here](https://weather-app-react-zeta.vercel.app/) to see the demo :) 

## Features

This application/site was created as a submission to a [DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/challenges) challenge. The [challenge](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/mM1UIenRhK808W8qmLWv) was to build an application to complete the given user stories :

- [x] I can see city weather as default, preferably my current location
- [x] I can search for city
- [x] I can see weather of today and the next 5 days
- [x] I can see the date and location of the weather
- [x] I can see according to image for each type of weather
- [x] I can see the min and max degree each day
- [x] I can see wind status and wind direction
- [x] I can see humidity percentage
- [x] I can see visibility indicator
- [x] I can see air pressure number
- [ ] I can request my current location weather (optional)
- [ ] I can convert temperature in Celcius to Fahrenheit and vice versa (optional)

### Built With

<!-- This section should list any major frameworks that you built your project using. Here are a few examples.-->

- [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/)
- [MetaWeather API](https://www.metaweather.com/api/)

## How To Use

<!-- Example: -->

To clone and run this application, you'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which comes with [npm](http://npmjs.com)) installed on your computer. From your command line:

```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/JessicaThi/weather-app-react.git

# Install dependencies
$ yarn install

# Run the app
$ yarn start
```

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
